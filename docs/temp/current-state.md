# InsightfulAI - Current State

## Project Status

The InsightfulAI project is currently in the initial development phase. We are setting up the core architecture and implementing the foundational components of both the backend and frontend.

## Completed Tasks

### Backend
- ✅ Defined API endpoints for user management
- ✅ Defined API endpoints for data collection
- ✅ Defined API endpoints for analysis
- ✅ Defined API endpoints for reports
- ✅ Defined API endpoints for competitor tracking

### Frontend
- ✅ Set up React with TypeScript project structure
- ✅ Created Material UI theme configuration
- ✅ Implemented authentication context
- ✅ Created main application layout
- ✅ Created authentication layout
- ✅ Implemented login page
- ✅ Implemented registration page
- ✅ Implemented forgot password page
- ✅ Implemented dashboard page with sample charts
- ✅ Created 404 Not Found page
- ✅ Implemented data collection interface
- ✅ Implemented analysis visualization components
- ✅ Implemented report generation UI
- ✅ Set up project documentation
